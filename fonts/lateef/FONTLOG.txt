Lateef font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Lateef font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Lateef fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi 
mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use 
in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Lateef Regular

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType 
technology.
